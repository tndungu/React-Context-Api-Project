# React Context Api Project

An app with 3 components, Login, Home and Settings, that demonstrates managing of Global state using React Context. LoggedIn flag for the user is provided from a Context Provider and other components subscribe to context changes to know whether a user is logged in or not. The app is created using React and TypeScript.

## Local Setup
